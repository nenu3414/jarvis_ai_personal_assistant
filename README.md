**Jarvis AI Assistant**

1.Summary:- I have tried to a basic ai assistant called Jarvis. It can perform operations like telling us time, date and wish us as per time. Along with basic operation it can also send emails, takes screenshots, play songs, tells us about cpu usage and tells you oneliner jokes, search on wikipedia and chrome, it also remembers what you will tell him to remember and recalls whenever needed.

2.Required modules to import:-   

a) pyttsx3

b) datetime

c) speech_recognition

d) wikipedia

e) smtplib

f) webdriver

g) keys

h) os

i) pyautogui

j) psutil

k) pyjokes

Apart from these modules which you will have to import into your file, you have to install pyaudio (pip install pyaudio for windows) on your device. It will let your microphone take input.



While sending mail from SMTP client you need to turn on some settings from your account.
Go to settings/manage your account tab in your account. Then there is Security tab, under this you will find "Less Secure App Access" tab [TURN ON this].

I will be making some updates in Songs function and Send Email function. Suggestions are most welcome. Do let me know about my faults.
